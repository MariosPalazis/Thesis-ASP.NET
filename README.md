DEVELOPMENT OF A DATABASE WEB APPLICATION IN ANALYSIS OF FOOTBALL MATCHES
The main purpose of this thesis is the design and development of a web application that helps monitoring the statistical information of football matches by the fans of the sport.
In more detail, this application hopes to offer to the visitors a variety of statistical information, grouped by the toping of their choosing, which would be difficult to extract without the application. More specifically, the web application collects and stores information about teams and players, like the results of the teams matches, the upcoming matches, the team’s strength, the player’s rate in each game, the player’s age and many more. All the information contained are inserted directly by the Application’s Manager or calculated indirectly by the application itself. Furthermore, except from the information which is offered, the web application, based on the database used, predicts possible results for the upcoming games.
For the development of the application I used the tool Visual Studio 2017 and the web environment ASP.NET provided by Microsoft. The database used was the SQL server, which is contained in Visual Studio. The tools which were used will be analyzed more extensively in the 2nd Chapter.
